      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Entry-level web developers, or junior web developers, code web programs and applications under the supervision of more senior developers. I start with simpler assignments, such as running tests and debugging, before moving to more complex assignments after I gain enough experience. I assist senior developers, submit software solutions and troubleshoot issues with programs and applications.</p>
      <p>Listening to music has always been my go to activity for all occasions. My love for music can be traced back to when I was a child. There are recorded videos of me as a child becoming hyperactive whenever music was played. I would run to the stereo, turn on the music to full volume and start running around dancing. Anyone who dared touch the sound system would face my wrath. Music was the only thing that could calm me down whenever I cried.</p>
